# Kernel Exploits

In this repository I would like to collect various exploits for the linux kernel,
eventually with writeups.

The exploits are written by me and my CTF team.

Inside every CTF challenge there is `extract.sh` to extract initramfs.

## CTF

| Challenge | Summary | Writeup |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Klibrary](./ctf/3k-2021-klibrary) | UAF + race condition (SLUB) | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [Pprofile](./ctf/line-2021-pprofile) | Unchecked copy_to_user | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [Hashbrown](./ctf/dice-2021-hashbrown) | UAF + race condition (SLAB) | :x: |
| [Kernel-Rop](./ctf/hxp-2020-kernel-rop) | ROP chain with KPTI+SMAP+SMEP+KASLR-FG | :x: |
| [Atoms](./ctf/hitcon-2020-atoms) | Kernel deadlock | :x: |
